### On-premise Computing
Traditional Web Application 
@ul
- Webserver / Proxy server
- Application server
- Database server

#### Traditional Web Application
What if.... potentially done with photos
@ul
- Hardware Failure?
- Deployment to another country?
- Huge increase in traffic?
@ulend
Note:
- Hardware failure will cause your applications to go down and if you don't have any spare servers to offer your service, cause an outage.
- When you rely on physical servers, you rely on a team of people to keep these running for you. What happens if you want to deploy your application on the other side of the world? New hardware, more workers, more cost.
- If your traffic suddenly surges beyond your maximum capacity, you can potentially miss out on an increase in business.
- This also increases your inital cost as you need to have servers capable of with standing the peak usage.

### The Downside with On-premise
@ul
- Upfront cost
- Accomodating for maximum load
- Slow provisioning
- Physical security
- High maintanence

### Cloud Computing
- The on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet.
- Cloud services come in a variety of models.
+++
### Cloud Service Models
![Cloud Service Models](demystifying-cloud/cloud-models.png)
+++
### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- The cloud provider hosts your infrastructure components that would traditionally be present in an on-site data center (such as servers, storage and networking hardware).
- Users maintain control over the operating systems, storage, networking & deployed applications.
+++
### Benefits of the IaaS
@ul
- On-demand compute resources
- Pay-as-you-go, no capital expenses
- Shared responsibility
- Most flexible cloud model
- Complete, scalable control of infrastructure
@ulend
+++
### Platform as a service (PaaS)
- Provides a managed platform to develop and run applications
- Eliminates need to install software or hardware, allowing the user to focus on the application.
+++
### Benefits of the PaaS
@ul
- On-demand application hosting
- Pay-as-you-go
- Reduced responsibiltiy
- Rapid Time-to-market
@ulend
+++
### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Provider sells an application as a service
- Fully hosted and managed by the provider
- Immediate access to full application services
+++
### Benefits of the SaaS
@ul
- On-demand applications
- Pay-per-user or Pay-per-license
- Accessible anywhere
@ulend
+++
### Serverless
- Cloud provider manages and orchastrates the execution of your application code to serve requests
- Consumers are only billed for the duration of code execution
Note:
- Serverless computing is a cloud computing code execution model in which the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping virtual machines as necessary to serve requests
- Consumers billed by an abstract measure of the resources required to satisfy the request, rather than per virtual machine, per hour
+++
### Benefits of the Serverless
@ul
- Significantly cheaper
- Pay-as-you-go, billed by millisecond
- Only focus on the code

## Cloud Service Providers
@ul
- Amazon Web Services
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform

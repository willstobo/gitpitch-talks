### On-premise Computing
Traditional Web Application 
@ul
- Webserver / Proxy server
- Application server
- Database server

#### Traditional Web Application

+++
#### Traditional Web Application
What if.... potentially done with photos
@ul
- Hardware Failure?
- Deployment to another country?
- Huge increase in traffic?
@ulend
+++
### The Downside with On-premise
@ul
- Upfront cost
- Accomodating for maximum load
- Slow provisioning
- Physical security
- High maintanence

### Cloud Computing
The on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet.

### Cloud Service Models

![Cloud Service Models](demystifying-cloud/Infra-Bot.png)
+++
### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
Where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls)
+++
### Benefits of the IaaS
@ul
- On-demand compute resources
- Pay-as-you-go, no upfront cost
- Shared responsibility
- Flexible
@ulend
+++
### Platform as a service (PaaS)
The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.
+++
### Benefits of the PaaS
@ul
- On-demand application hosting
- Pay-as-you-go
- Reduced responsibiltiy
@ulend
+++
### Software as a Service (SaaS)
The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.

### Benefits of the SaaS

### Serverless
Serverless computing is a cloud computing code execution model in which the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping virtual machines as necessary to serve requests, and requests are billed by an abstract measure of the resources required to satisfy the request, rather than per virtual machine, per hour
+++
### Benefits of the Serverless
@ul
- Significantly cheaper
- Pay-as-you-go to the millisecond

## Cloud Service Providers
@ul
- Amazon Web Services
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform
